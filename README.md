## cargo nono - Detect (possible) no_std compatibility of your crate and dependencies

## Motivation

From embedded programming, over smart contracts in Rust, to general cross-platform portable crates, `#![no_std]` crates are becoming more and more widespread.
However it is currently a very cumbersome process to find out if and why (not) a crate is compatible with `no_std` usage, and often requires a lengthy trial and error process, and digging through the source of all your dependencies.

**cargo nono** tries to aid you in navigating the current minefield that is `no_std` usage, and it's biggest "no no"s.

## Installation

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install cargo-davinono
# For warnings with more informative messages install like this
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg procmacro2_semver_exempt" cargo install cargo-davinono
```

## Demo

## Usage

Run in the crate directory you want to check:

```
cargo nono check
```

The `cargo nono check` subcommand also understands the `--no-default-features` and `--features <FEATURES>` flags to help in conditional `no_std` setups.

## Features

- Tries to infer `no_std` compatibility in dependencies by looking for a `#![no_std]` attribute or the often used conditional `#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]`
- Helps in pinpointing which dependencies and feature flags activate `std` feature flags
- Warn of `use std::` statements in code

### Planned features

- Warn of `[build-dependencies]` features bleeding over: [cargo#5730](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5730)
- Alos Warn `use std::`, but this code above have #[cfg(feature = "std")] or #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
